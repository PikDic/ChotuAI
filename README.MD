# 🛒 ChotuAI — Dukaan ka AI Assistant

**Built by Pratik (aka the guy who thought kirana shops deserve their own Jarvis).**

## 🤖 What is ChotuAI?

Think of it as your shop’s *chhota dost* who:

* 💬 Answers inventory questions in plain Hinglish
* 📦 Tells you what’s left in stock
* 📉 Suggests reorders before you run out
* 🔌 Works offline (because WiFi ka bharosa nahi)
* 🤪 Cracks jokes when you’re bored

No dashboards, no enterprise nonsense, no ₹2999 setup fee.
Bas ek laptop, thoda RAM, aur Chotu.

---

## ⚡ Why?

Because Excel feels like torture,
Billing apps feel like scams,
And shopkeepers just need something simple that talks back.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Chutney

* Electron + Node
* Python backend with LLM (Llama3.2)
* PostgreSQL for dukaandari data
* Streamlit (for testing UI)

---

## 🚀 Future (if Pratik doesn’t get lazy)

* Voice commands in Hindi
* CSV upload for pen-paper logbooks
* Cute charts
* Maybe even an app for Android

---

## ❤️ Note from Pratik

Not trying to build a unicorn 🦄
Just trying to build something that even a kirana shop owner in Odisha can actually *use*.
